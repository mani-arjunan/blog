    <h1>LeetCode :( is it worth</h1>
    <p>
      Does LeetCoding improves our coding knowledge or is it a flex symbol for
      developers.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the people who doesn’t know leetcode, It is an online platform to
      practice various coding problems with different levels of complexity.

    <h2>How i started my leetcode journey</h2>
    <p>
      I started my career as a FE developer with blazingly fast(although it is
      not) React and Next JS like most of us out there, but later realized that
      FE it’s not a thing for me, I personally felt kinda of bored or doing some
      repetitive stuffs, that’s when i thought of moving on to a BE
      development(OG Software Engineer).
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, to make this switch over either i need to do a internal job
      switch for BE role or i need to do DSA and Algo’s stuff to clear the
      interview process for BE role and move to some other organization, i did
      the later part. I started coding in hackerrank, freecodecamp etc, then i
      realized most of the so called linkedIn flexers use leetcode to flex their
      coding knowledge, So i also wanted to do that shit :(
    </p>
    <p>
      Started my leetcode from here and nearly solved 150+ (YES AM FLEXING)
      problems in 1.5years of timespan, but after nearly 2 years i got so many
      questions asking myself do i really need Leetcode now, do i need to solve
      problems daily, do i need to maintain my daily streak, do i need to
      Leetcode for my next interview process. Personally i don’t know how to get
      out from all these questions, but i did some of the things to answer all
      the above questions to myself, which am gonna share it below.
    </p>
    <h2>Leetcode! Does it needed for us(developers)?</h2>
    <p>
      To simply answer the question, it could be Yes and No. Leetcode is really
      useful if we are a complete beginner to problem solving or if we are just
      starting our college/career or for anyone who wants to improve their
      problem solving techniques, once you got some hands on or once you got
      enough confidence of thinking on how to solve any problem and how to
      choose a DataStructure for a given situation, then Leetcode shouldn’t even
      be on the developer daily task list.
    </p>
    <p>
      My personal take on Leetcode is once you got comfortable with solving
      80–100 problems(based on the complexity it can be easy(50%), medium(40%),
      hard(10%)) you are good to get out from the Leetcode Hell.
    </p>
    <h2>So, What developers need then?</h2>
    <p>
      As said above once you got enough comfortable from leetcode, just move out
      of it and get into the real Software Engineering, there are multiple
      stuffs to learn in software engineering, once i realized that am doing too
      much leetcode, I somehow got out of it and started to learn things like
      OS, Database internals, how CLI works, how to publish our backend app in
      our own baremetal server(could be our personal computer) etc, these things
      really helped me alot to understand my BE better, so folks that already in
      Leetcode hell, try to remember that there are alot more things to know as
      a developer rather than doing competitive coding.
    </p>
    <p>
      So yeah! as said above one can use Leetcode for a certain level(which is
      necessary as i feel), but dont trap into it like myself, just get of it
      whenever you feel confidence in problem solving, and started building
      things.
