  <h1>Traceroute: How It Works Under the Hood</h1>
  <p>
    Many software devs have already aware of the tool called
    <b>Traceroute</b>. For those who don’t know, Traceroute is a tool, used to
    determine the path of your request transfer over the internet.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, if you run traceroute https://google.com, it shows you the
    network path that your data packets take to reach <b>google.com</b> from
    <b>your network.</b>

  <h2>
    Before getting into the details, will clear about some basic stuff that is
    associated to traceroute.
  </h2>
  <h3>The OSI Model</h3>
  <p>
    As many of you may be aware, the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model
    is a framework used to understand network stuff. Since this article
    focuses more on Traceroute, I will try to cover more about the stuff that
    is happening on Layer 3 of the OSI model, the <b>Network</b> Layer. You
    can read more about the OSI Model

  </p>
  <h3>Layer 3(Network Layer)</h3>
  <p>
    Layer 3, or the Network Layer, is responsible for transmitting our data in
    form of <b>packets</b> between devices on a network. Particularly, it
    handles the transmission of packets from our source IP to the destination
    IP.
  </p>
  <p>
    It does not care about anything else like <b>port numbers</b> or the
    actual application-level communication. Its primary job is to route the
    packets from one device to another across different networks.

    Wikipedia).

  <h3>ICMP</h3>
  <p>
    ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) is a protocol that too comes
    under Layer 3 (the Network Layer).
  </p>
  <p>
    It’s mostly used by tools like <b>ping</b> and <b>traceroute</b> to send
    information or error messages about the network conditions.
  </p>
  <p>
    ICMP plays a crucial part for the functioning of Traceroute, as it helps
    to send the progress of data packets as they move across the internet(in
    simple terms across different routers/devices).
  </p>
  <h3>TTL</h3>
  <p>
    Now, let’s talk about <b>TTL</b> (Time To Live), which serves as an
    important concept to understand how Traceroute works.
  </p>
  <p>
    TTL serves many purposes, but one of its primary purpose is to prevent
    packets from circulating indefinitely inside network devices(routers) if
    in case they get stuck in a routing loop.
  </p>
  <p>
    Imagine you’re sending a packet from your home network to a Google server.
    Along the way, the packet may pass through multiple devices(for eg
    Router1, Router2, Router3, etc). What if, due to some network failure, the
    packet starts looping between two routers indefinitely (e.g., Router 1 →
    Router 3 → Router 2 → Router 3 → Router 2… and so on)?
  </p>
  <p>
    To prevent this kinda looping scenario, TTL comes handy. TTL ensures that
    if a packet is stuck in such a loop, it will eventually be discarded after
    reaching its TTL limit, and the sender will be notified with an error
    message
  </p>
  <h3>How devices(eg routers) make use of this TTL</h3>
  <p>
    Whenever a source router starts to send packet, it starts with an initial
    TTL value (for this example, let’s say it starts at TTL=3). Each time the
    packet passes through a router, that router decrements the TTL value by 1.
    This process continues to travel across routers, whenever this TTL value
    becomes 0, the router discards the packet and sends an ICMP message to its
    sender with the error code as <b>“Time Exceeded”</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This mechanism ensures that packets that can’t find their destination do
    not remain on the network forever.
  </p>

  <cite>
    From the above image, Since the packets can able to reach from
    src(1.1.1.1) to dest(5.5.5.5), discarding of packet is not needed.</cite>
  <h3>How Traceroute uses the TTL to determine the path</h3>
  <p>
    Traceroute basically uses this <b>TTL</b> value to map the path across the
    src and dest networks.
  </p>
  <p>
    Traceroute begins by sending packets with a low TTL value — initially 1
    from the src network. The first router in the path receives the packet and
    decrements the TTL by 1, since now the TTL becomes 0, the router discards
    the packet and sends an ICMP message “Time Exceeded” back to the sender.
  </p>
  <p>
    Traceroute then again increments the TTL and sends another packet with
    TTL=2. This time, the first router allows the packet to pass by
    decrementing the TTL value with 1, and the second router receives it. The
    second router again decrements the TTL value by 1, since now the TTL
    becomes 0, the router discards the packet and sends an ICMP message “Time
    Exceeded” back to its sender.
  </p>
  <p>
    This process repeats with incrementing TTL values until the packet reaches
    the destination. At that point, the destination sends an ICMP “Destination
    Unreachable” or “Echo Reply” message back to the sender, signaling that
    the trace is complete. In this way, Traceroute can determine the path
    (i.e., the sequence of routers) taken by the packet to reach the
    destination.
  </p>
  <cite>Following 3 images explain how traceroute can able to fetch the path by
    each time incrementing the value of <b>TTL</b> by 1, untill it reaches the
    destination path.</cite>
  <br />
  <br />
  <img src="./trace1.webp" alt="trace1" />
  <img src="./trace2.webp" alt="trace2" />
  <img src="./trace3.webp" alt="trace3" />
  <p>
    Yep, this is how traceroute use <b>TTL</b> effectively in order to
    determine the network path.
  </p>
  <h3>Final Note, Can Traceroute be wrong</h3>
  <p>
    While exploring this Traceroute working, I had a question with myself,
    What happens when the network path changes? since, networks are dynamic,
    and routing paths can change for many reasons like load balancing, node
    failure, or changes in routing rules.
  </p>
  <p>
    In these cases, Traceroute may
    <b>not always gives the most accurate or up-to-date network path</b>. It's
    important to remember that traceroute gives the path at the time that it
    runs, and this path could change depending on the network's current state.
    It's a useful tool for troubleshooting, but it may not be always 100%
    reliable in our dynamic network environment.
